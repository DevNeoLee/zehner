# Site Test for Z

## Objective

### To implement a site design given and features as close as it appears on its design on Figma

---

## Strategy
1. Implement HTML CSS
2. Complete them responsive
3. Javascript funtions

---
## Thoughts on CSS
- Tried to make as many utility classes, variables reusable throughout the site

- Profer balance of flex and grid layout for different situations in most effective ways

- media query to different size of screen devices
---

## Thoughts on Javascript
- add EventListners for buttons and links

- use of CSS utility classes to add and remove to classList when the buttons clicked

## Thoughts on Future Implementations
- vanilla javascript to design single-page-application as much to get close the features showed on your design markup

- the native JS capabilities to write code to implement
1. modular JS
2. navigation with a router
3. hosting and loading pages
